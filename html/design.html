                                Honestly, almost none of these requirements made sense when I saw
                                them for the first time. Later on, I realized that a lot of the concepts
                                we'd apply to our designs were actually concepts taught in third-year, 
                                but the teaching team helped us learn
                                quickly enough to design our board.

                                <br><br>

                                That help came after the first design review, where we learned just how
                                much was wrong with our first design.

                                Before moving into what's wrong with this design, I'd like to mention one thing we
                                did right&#8212;op-amp biasing. The motherboard only supplied us with 5V and GND 
                                terminals, meaning our signals had to be centred at 2.5V to make use of the op-amps.
                                If you look at the C1-R1-R2, C3-R7-R8 and C4-R11-R12 combinations, they centre the
                                input signals and the op-amp positive terminal in U1B. We made sure the cut-off frequency
                                of the resistor and capacitor combinations was high enough to allow our signals to pass 
                                through.

                                <br><br>

                                As for the problem, it has to do with the first op-amp. In SSB Demodulation, the
                                I and Q signals are shifted 90 degrees apart and then added together.
                                This gives us an audio signal at the output terminal of the second op-amp. The first op-amp
                                is an All-Pass Filter (APF) that shifts the Q signal by 90 degrees, and the second op-amp is
                                a Summing Amplifier that adds the two signals together. 
                                
                                <br><br>

                                The issue was that the APF only shifted 10kHz signals by 90 degrees, rather than a 
                                range of frequencies. Even if the SSB signal was centred at 10kHz, the message signal (audio)
                                ranges from 0 - 3kHz on top of that, which would have given us an improper phase shift.
                                The summing was done right, even though it's an inverted (audio) signal. Audio can be upside 
                                down, or you'd hear something different when you put your headphones on upside-down.

                                In AM Demodulation, the Amplitude-Modulated (AM) signal is first passed through an 
                                Envelope detector which traces the amplitude of the signal with less perturbation.
                                Then that signal passes through a Band-Pass Filter (BPF) which further smoothens out the signal,
                                leaving us with a filtered audio signal. There's a formula for the R13-C5 combination that we 
                                used to make sure it optimally envelopes the 40kHz - 100kHz AM signal.

                                The C7-R15-R16 combination was to bias the signal at 2.5V, to centre it for the op-amps
                                ahead of it (which were ultimately redundant, scroll down to read more). Typically an
                                AM Demodulator has only a Low-Pass Filter, but the biasing turned it into a BPF in our initial
                                design.

                                We thought we'd need Unity Gain Buffers (UGB) to duplicate the audio signal without loss.
                                We were wrong. Turns out a single audio amplifier chip was enough to amplify the 
                                signal for both left and right audio channels (there's adequate impedance at the input and 
                                output terminals of the chip), so we were able to remove 75% of the
                                components in this part of the design. The UGBs weren't AC coupled with a capacitor to the
                                audio amplifier chips, so that was another issue we overlooked in our first iteration.

                        A few weeks later, we had our second design review. We showcased an organized
                        design for our board to the teaching team which had far fewer issues. We added
                        a test point between the demodulators and the audio amplifier, which is the perfect 
                        point to test all three systems independently with a single reference point. We 
                        also implemented an LED indicator light to avoid having to check for power every
                        time we tested the circuit.

                                This time a chain of three APFs for both input signals was used. We
                                found a reference design that was provided by the TA to help us choose our
                                element values, which creates a clean range of 90-degree phase shifting between
                                250Hz to 3.6kHz as you can see in the output graph. The Summing Amplifier was

                                Not much changed here apart from removing the 2.5V biasing, since we didn't

                                Since the second Audio Amplifier and the UGBs had been removed,
                                the design became a lot simpler. We also added C11, which AC couples the demodulators
                                (mainly the SSB since it is sending a signal biased to 2.5V) to the amplifier.

                                We had a minor issue with this design which was never solved. Since we only had
                                a 5V supply, the amplifier would clip the audio if we set the volume too high with the 
                                potentiometer. Ultimately we used a higher resistance potentiometer which made our
                                design capable of 65% volume before clipping.

                    <p class="justify textpad">
                        A week after the second design review, our PCB Designs were due for review
                        (as well as circuit reviews for teams that needed more design tweaks). I spent
                        the entire week avoiding my other course work to arrange our design as best as 
                        possible and ordering parts since it was challenging to fit everything on such a small
                        board. I could have chosen to place all the resistors in a hairpin style, but I 
                        wanted to make sure our design followed good practices. It was also my favourite 
                        part of the project and I was very satisfied with the PCB arrangement :)

                        <br><br>

                        In terms of good practice, I also put ground planes on both the top and bottom planes.
                        We didn't learn much about EM shielding, but for safe measure, I added via stitching between
                        the two ground planes.
